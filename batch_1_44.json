There had been no time spared to comfort me all those years ago when we all realized my body couldn\u2019t tolerate the life of a proofer; I\u2019d simply recovered from another health crisis to find my Tashi\u2019s time devoted instead to my small brother. The same honor and duty that was taken from me still bound our family to the Chancellor, and while he still lived we couldn\u2019t pause to grieve for our own uncle.\nBut already it seemed hopeless. Jovan and I stole moments where we could talk out of hearing of the physics, whispering thoughts and theories, reaching dead ends. It had to be poison, surely, for all the physics\u2019 talk of unknown diseases\u2014 and I knew as well as anyone their fascination with unexplained ailments\u2014because no one else had fallen sick. But if so, it was one Jovan didn\u2019t know. And he knew all of the poisons. Or at least we\u2019d thought he did.\nJovan leaped to his feet, pacing again. I sat on the floor, back to my uncle\u2019s body, knees drawn up to my chest and arms wrapped around my bare shins. He took his measured steps: left, right, left, right, spin to the left, left, right, left, right, spin to the right. The impeccably timed sound of his feet on the floor, in precisely equal steps, tapped out the rhythm of my childhood. Always balanced, no movement with one side of his body failing to be echoed by an equal one on the other. I rested my head back on the bed, watching him. Although average in his dark coloring and his medium height and build, my brother was striking in his symmetry and precision, even at his most anxious. Perhaps\nespecially\nat his most anxious. His breath released slowly as his pacing calmed",
    "I find it intriguing that in two of the stories, the painting itself is part of the setting and plays a role. The relation of illustration to the written word is complex and deep, and is centuries old. Perhaps a lot older. In my imagination there were words in some oral tradition associated with the astonishing cave paintings of the Neanderthals in Europe.\nThere are a number of ways one can interpret a painting, and I asked the writers in this case to interpret this in the direction of science fiction. As you can tell in particular from the Judith Moffett story, a consideration of the image can evoke a variety of responses. But whatever the image, it becomes a repository of things the writer wishes to express, and becomes embedded in the prose fiction, uniquely in each story.\nThere were other writers invited to submit work and I anticipate at least a couple of stories appearing in a year or two in other venues that began as drafts for this project, but could not be completed now. The three stories here, though, are finished and accomplished and make a set. They are in my opinion of high quality and it is my hope that you enjoy them.\nThose writers and stories are:\n\u201cReborn\u201d by Ken Liu\n\u201cSpace Ballet\u201d by Judith Moffett\nAppearing on Tor.com on February 4\n\u201cWhere Do We Come From?

    "Raising the dead is easy. Living is harder.\nEli doesn\u2019t know who he is or who he came from. Three years ago, he was found by his now-best friends, Sunny and Max, who gave him a home in a magical sanctuary doubling as a Caribbean restaurant. What Eli does know is that he can heal a wound with just a touch and pluck magic from a soul like a petal from a flower\u2014and there is nothing he wouldn\u2019t do to survive and keep his new family together.\nMalcolm would do anything to forget where he comes from. Desperate to escape his estranged father\u2019s shadow and plagued with an inherited death magic he doesn\u2019t fully understand, Malcolm has just one priority: save his mother, no matter the cost.\nMalcolm and Eli\u2019s paths collide when Eli and his friends are sent to track down the fang of the leopard god Osebo, a deadly weapon that can eat magic. In a job filled with enigmatic nine nights and Caribbean legends, the teens must face their own demons as they race through the magical underbelly of London to retrieve the fang\u2026 before an ancient and malevolent power comes back to life.\nChapter One\nEli\nThe soul slipped from the boy as easily as removing a sheet from a bed.\nIt felt a little like that, Eli thought as he took it in his hand; thin, weightless, like releasing a kite in the wind. He got a sense of the life as it passed through him. He had read before in one of Max\u2019s old books that the magic in each soul had its own individuality; this one felt like motor grease on fingers and grass stains on knees, the smell of petrol, the hum of an engine. He was a mechanic, Eli realized belatedly. He had spent a lifetime working with his hands.\nIn theory, it was simple. The boy\u2019s soul was battered and broken; Eli was just stitching the fragments back together one at a time, like patchwork. It was a complicated magic, healing; one wrong stitch and it wouldn\u2019t stick. Plus, it took from him as much as he gave. Afterward, Eli would feel worn out, nauseous, and it usually took a few days for his own magic to return.\nHe didn\u2019t have the luxury of goi",
    ".\nEthan Kaille could count on one hand the number of times in recent years he had refused an ale in favor of some stronger spirit. He rarely had enough coin for anything more than the cheap ales that came out of Boston\u2019s local breweries, and even when he did, he usually preferred the pale ales of Kent to whiskey or rum. But December had brought gray skies and frigid winds to the New England colonies, and even the fine fish chowder served here in the Dowsing Rod, a tavern on Sudbury Street, wasn\u2019t enough to ward off the chill.\nWith a cup of hot rum warming his hands, however, and several sips of the toddy already heating his belly, Ethan could convince himself that winter\u2019s advance had been slowed, at least for the evening.\nMost of the tavern\u2019s patrons sat or stood in a tight arc around the hearth, where a bright fire blazed. They laughed and told stories; a few sang songs like \u201cYe Good Fellows All\u201d and \u201cPreach Not to Me Your Musty Rules.\u201d Ethan, though, kept to himself. A few of the others might have welcomed him, but most knew him to be a convict and thought of him as a troublemaker and an unrepentant mutineer. A few might even have known that he was a conjurer.\nOn the other hand, the tavern\u2019s owner, a young widow named Kannice Lester, had lately taken an interest in him, and he in her. As he sat watching the men by the fire and chuckling to himself at their poor singing, Kannice brought him a second bowl of chowder. He hadn\u2019t asked for it.\n\u201cI thought you might enjoy a bit more,\u201d she said, placing it in front of him. \u201cWhat with the others hogging the fire and all.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nShe tucked a strand of auburn hair behind her ear and gestured at the empty chair opposite his. \u201cMay I sit for a moment?\u201d\nHe grinned at that. \u201cI believe it\u2019s your tavern, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cAye, it is.\u201d She sat, rested an elbow on the table and her chin in her palm. \u201cYou\u2019re an odd man, Ethan Kaille.\u201d\n\u201cAm I?\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cYou keep apart from the others, as if you don\u2019t want any company. Yet you come in here night after night, when you could just",
    "Deviously plotted and full of dark wit, James Renner\u2019s\nThe Man from Primrose Lane\nis an audacious debut that boasts as many twists as a roller coaster. But beneath its turns, it\u2019s a spellbinding story about our obsessions: the dangerous sway they have over us and the fates of those we love.\nTHE BALLAD OF THE LOVELAND FROG\n1986\nHalfway through Johnny Carson, the rotary phone on the side table by his father\u2019s recliner rang out. Everett Bleakney, age nine, looked forward to these interludes in the middle of otherwise normal eve nings. That particular phone had its own extension. It only rang if there was trouble. And when it rang during the weekends, Everett\u2019s father had to take him along for the ride. That was the deal they had hashed out long ago.\n\u201cBleakney,\u201d his father said into the phone. \u201cUh-huh. Uh-huh. Huh! Hurm. Uh. Uhuh. Yes, thank you.\u201d\nEverett, lying on the living room floor, looked up.\n\u201cGet your coat,\u201d his father said.\n\u201cYes!\u201d\nHis mother, a gaunt woman who was reading\nFlowers in the Attic\nat a seat beneath a lamp in the corner, gave a curt sound of disapproval. \u201cIt\u2019s late, hon.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a drive-by,\u201d his father said, standing up and drinking the rest of his Yuengling in one quick gulp. \u201cLana Deering saw some animal out on Twightwee.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of animal?\u201d she asked without looking up.\n\u201cFrog.\u201d\n\u201cA frog?\u201d\n\u201cA big frog.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, then. But don\u2019t stay out. And don\u2019t take him into Paxton\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my son hanging out in bars.\u201d\n\u201cAll right. No Paxton\u2019s,\u201d he said. But he winked at Everett in a conspiratorial way.\nEverett sat in the passenger seat of his father\u2019s cruiser, warming his hands against the dashboard vents. It was cool out to night, too cool for early September. There might even be a frost on the corn come morning, the newspaper warned.\n\u201cHow big was the frog Mrs. Deering saw?\u201d asked Everett.\n\u201c \u2018Monstrous\u2019 was the word she used, I think,\u201d said his father. \u201cAt least that\u2019s what Dory told me.\u201d Dory was the Friday night dispatcher. \u201cI guess it\u2019s just sitting out there on Twightwee,",
    "But it\u2019s all the same for Katherine Moriarty, a singer whose sudden fame and precipitous downfall were followed by the mysterious death of her estranged husband\u2014suicide, allegedly. Her trauma has made her agoraphobic, shackled within the confines of her apartment. Her son, Nick, has moved home to care for her, quietly making his living working for Hutch\u2019s boss.\nWhen Hutch calls Nick in distress, looking for someone else to take the hand, Katherine and Nick are plunged into a global struggle that will decimate the walls of the carefully arranged life they\u2019ve built. Mother and son must evade both crazed, bloodthirsty masses and deceitful government agents while exorcising family secrets that have risen from the dead\u2014secrets, they soon discover, that might hold the very key to humanity\u2019s survival.\nJOHN BONNER\nThe medical examiner\u2019s office is two stories of brick and glass. Modern, clean-lined, tucked behind a sizable parking lot that\u2019s sparsely filled at this hour, with high green hedges flanking both sides. The rear of the building butts up against an equally nondescript office building. Were it not for an ambulance and a pair of police cruisers parked amid the rest of the cars, Bonner wouldn\u2019t have a clue. Some part of him really had expected an old Victorian with turrets, maybe a black cat weathervane. You hear about the dead rising, your head goes in a certain direction. Thing was, Bonner had\nseen\nthe man in his car, buckled in, seen the horrible wound in his throat, the spill of blood in his lap. Bonner would have sworn on his own life that the man was dead as hell, dead beyond any inkling of awareness, dead forever. According to the police radio, that isn\u2019t the case.

    "PROLOGUE\n\u201cYou have all heard of the time when the dead didn\u2019t tread upon the land?\u201d\nThe sea of youthful faces shone with the golden light of the hearth. The children nodded, expressions flooded with concern or fear. Even so, they were spellbound, as they were every night at this time, when they huddled on the floor surrounded by adults who gathered in chairs or leaned against the walls.\nI turned to gaze out the window. The children\u2019s curiosity prompted them to follow my lead. By the silvery light of the moon, we could see the wanderers ambling in the dark. Their cloudy gazes appeared distant as they searched. Their pale flesh was frigid blue in the moonlight, cold as the late autumn night. The front door rattled, and everyone jumped. It failed to open, and the wanderer moved on, passing by the window without a glance.\nBeside me, young Corin gripped his older brother\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t like to think about it,\u201d he said.\nI mussed the boy\u2019s hair and replied, \u201cWe cannot ignore the truth just because we don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s important to understand how the world became the way it is so that we can learn and grow. Survival is never guaranteed. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite.\u201d\nCorin glanced up at his brother, then back to me with a nod.\nI leaned back in my chair and recalled the words of my mother, the same words spoken by her father and his before him. \u201cThe living once walked this world alone. They worked the land, growing sustenance for themselves and their children. They built homes and palaces. They sailed the seas, explored distant lands, and shared their dreams in artwork and mesmerizing enactments. Wizards and witches, mages and sorcerers, and all sorts of other magi performed feats great and small with their wondrous magic. For seculars like ourselves, life was made easier.\n\u201cBack then, when a person\u2019s time was finished, his or her soul passed into the next realm, and the body was laid to rest\u2014to rot\u2014beneath the ground.\u201d I met their pensive stares and leaned forward. \u201cThat was before the dead rose, before the Grave",
    "I can tell by your faces that you think you recognize me. I can see you trying to figure it out. It\u2019s true, I grew up here, I\u2019m\nfrom\nhere, but I haven\u2019t lived in town for some time. Even then I never really made myself known. There\u2019s no reason you\u2019d know me, I guess is what I\u2019m saying. I wasn\u2019t\nout and about\n. I mostly just went to school or drove around. The usual things. You must know there\u2019s never been much to do here. For a while when I was fourteen or fifteen I had this thing where every couple weeks I\u2019d poke around in the antique shops down the street. I\u2019d never buy anything. There was never anything new, always the same old crap. But I kept going back, creaking into each room and picking through it all, like I might find something I couldn\u2019t live without.\n\nMaybe you recognize my dad in me. The resemblance is not exactly subtle. My mom used to make a big deal about it, like it was some mystery where I came from. I\u2019ve seen that face before, she\u2019d say. I know that face. Whenever I would scrunch my nose or bug my eyes. Whenever I was being impatient or ironic. Whenever I gave a look that said,\nWhat are you gonna do?\nor,\nHey, don\u2019t look at\nme. That\u2019s when the face I was given became most like the face of the man who\u2019d given it to me. But then again, I doubt you\u2019d remember him either. My dad lived here for far less time than I did and wasn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d call a\nsocial but\u00adterfly\n. He was never much interested in people, or only ever in the smallest doses. And from what I remember, he did most of his drinking at home.\nOr maybe it\u2019s that I don\u2019t look like you all. It\u2019s a difference you\u2019re noticing rather than any familiarity. That\u2019s not an insult. It\u2019s just a function of a small town and this one is like any other. Sometimes the clich\u00e9s are true. Everybody kind of looks the same, dresses the same. It doesn\u2019t take a lot to stick out. It can be as subtle as a hairstyle or the cut on a pair of jeans. Small towns lag behind. That\u2019s partly why I came here. You can feel untethered in a place like this. There\u2019s a s",
    "I\u2019ve loved working with Richard Baker on\nValiant Dust\n, and I think I\u2019ve fallen a little in love with Sikander and the crew of the\nHector\n. I hope that readers enjoy their adventures as well.\nChapter 1\nNew Perth, Caledonia System\nLieutenant Sikander Singh North leaned forward in the shuttle\u2019s right-hand seat, eager to catch his first glimpse of the light cruiser\nHector\n. The shuttle climbed slowly into low orbit, only four hundred kilometers above the feathered white cloud tops and graygreen dayside of New Perth. The white glare of Caledonia\u2019s sun illuminated dozens of freighters and tugs going about their business in the planet\u2019s busy approaches. Sikander quickly spotted the huge mass of New Perth Fleet Base\u2014hard to miss, really, since the orbital structure was the size of a small city\u2014and narrowed his eyes, peering in turn at each of the ships moored to the station\u2019s long arms. To his disappointment, the hulls of the Aquilan warships all looked the same at this distance; he felt he should have been able to spot his new ship as easily as he might pick out a pretty girl\u2019s face from a crowd. He\u2019d certainly spent enough time memorizing every detail of CSS\nHector\n\u2019s lines and armament over the month and a half since he\u2019d received his new assignment.\nBeside him Petty Officer Second Class Robert Long, a pilot in\nHector\n\u2019s Flight Department, smiled. He\u2019d guessed exactly what Sikander was doing, and he pointed out the docked cruiser for him. \u201cLeft-hand side of Fleet Base, sir, the second berth from the top. We\u2019ll be there in just a minute.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Sikander replied. He looked where the pilot pointed, and there was the Aquilan Commonwealth starship\nHector\n, hull number CL 88. She was not the newest or largest of the ships moored at New Perth\u2019s orbital dock, but she was a handsome vessel nonetheless. He tapped the visual controls for the shuttle\u2019s viewports and zoomed in for a good look. Two hundred and sixty meters long, the Ilium-class cruiser (so called because all of her sisters were named for Trojan heroes from",

Be sure to read their spotlight piece for more on\nhow Ian Tregillis decided to stretch his skills with an angelic noir\n!\n1\nYou Should Hear the Funeral Choir\nThey murdered one of the Seraphim tonight.\nGabriel streaked across the heavens like a tumbling meteor, his corpse a fireball of sublimated perfection. He had been a creature of peerless majesty, but now the throes of his death etched the firmament.\nHis wings, all six, shed embers of incandescent grace as he skidded across the night sky. And when he opened his mouths to scream, the Earth could do naught but shudder. The roar of his lion\u2019s visage registered a 5.2 on the Richter, six hundred miles east of Kyoto. The bellow of his ox\u2019s muzzle roused a dormant volcano in Hawaii. The shriek of his eagle aspect crumbled chimneys in Seattle. The inaudible cry from his human face left people from Melbourne to Perth weeping in troubled slumber, dreaming of colors that no longer existed and sounds that hadn\u2019t been heard since the Earth was just magma and poison. Meanwhile, turbulence roiled a cloud of dark matter sleeting through the solar system.\nBut that was Gabriel for you. Platonically perfect, blindingly beautiful. He wasn\u2019t just lovely, he was the kind of lovely that could make a bishop stomp his miter and curse a long blue streak on Easter Sunday.\nDon\u2019t believe me? I saw him do it once. On a bet.\nFun guy, Gabby.\nGabriel had been there when the sun emitted its first feeble glow, flapping his wings like a bellows to fan the coals of Creation. After the planets congealed from hot primordial soot, Gabriel\u2019s gentle breath cooled the Earth\u2019s crust. And when the onion-skin atmosphere needed protection, it was Gabriel who stirred the Earth\u2019s molten core with his flaming sword to impel the dynamo that would deflect the ravaging solar wind. He\u2019d serenaded the cyanobacteria that pumped oxygen into the primeval atmosphere and sang a dirge for the dinosaurs.\nHe had a real fondness for this place. And he never begrudged the",
    "One\nGideon Bardsley was working in the basement of the former Jefferson Hospital, which had been converted into the science center that housed his laboratory, when the first window broke. He heard the brittle sound of glass being strategically shattered, but he did not turn off the machine. Instead, he glanced at the dial beside his hand. Its tiny needle leaned hard past the yellow warning threshold, and tapped against the red zone.\nA second window broke upstairs.\nHe rejected the reflex to look up at the basement door. Looking at the basement door would not tell him anything he did not already know\u2014nothing he could not discern from the sounds of motion upstairs. Two intruders, at least. Entering from the western side of the building. Not close yet; not even in the correct wing of the disused hospital space. But coming.\nHe had time, but not much.\nGideon reached for a large glass knob and turned it carefully, but as quickly as he dared. He checked the dial again. Its needle careened farther to the right, fully in the red, but fairly stable. The lever on the left would activate the printing apparatus upstairs. He pulled it.\nHe needed an answer, and he needed it\nnow\n.\nThe mighty computational engine strained and hummed, its gears and chains struggling against the request. At the rear a fuse fizzled and popped, but did not blow; a circuit objected with a fit of sparks, but held steady; a row of lights flickered, but did not go out.\nNow\nGideon looked up at the basement door. He stared at it. Hard. And he willed the system to work the way he told it to\u2014please, just this once, if never again.\nThree seconds passed. He knew because he counted.\nClick.\nWhir.\nA blue-green glow sparked to life on the machine as a thin line of watery light pooled through the crack where the bottom of the door met the top stair.\n\u201c\nYes\n,\u201d Gideon breathed, but he did not smile. Turning on the apparatus was not the hard part. It was the first hard part.\nThe printer was far too large to share the basement with its companion device, which occupied tw",
    "Prologue\nWe lived in a long flat bungalow in Creemore. It was a mixture of gray brick and faded blue aluminum siding. I can remember other things about that house\u2014the pond, a tree outside, the bush that flowered in the spring with little tiny pink rosebuds that actually weren\u2019t rosebuds, but opened like them, and smelled sweet. It\u2019s not a common bush, but I\u2019ve seen it here and there in the springs that have followed, and whenever I do, I think of that backyard, and the tree, and the little path that wandered between the bushes and the fence, made not by design, but by the constant patrol of two kids. I remember using that path to follow my best friend, a boy twelve minutes older than me, but two inches taller, with blond hair that curled. He was my brother, and I called him Lexi.\nMore facts. The ones that hurt. A Werewolf killed my father, and the Fae executed my mother. They took my brother Lexi with them across a portal I could never breach.\nThey left me behind.\nChapter One\nWhat do the tree huggers call it? Karma?\nNo, wait a minute; that\u2019s not right. \u201cKarma\u201d is just a word for what goes around comes around, isn\u2019t it? And on the surface, Robson Trowbridge\u2019s only crime was to have been the hot guy in school who was totally oblivious to the bottom dwellers of his world.\nLike me, Hedi Peacock, formerly Helen Stronghold, and still, unfortunately, a bottom dweller.\n\u201cKarma\u201d isn\u2019t the word I was looking for.

But still, I wish someone would even it out, make it so that everyone had the same luck and chances. If I created the world, you could bet there would be a set of natural laws, and one of them would be the Law of You Can\u2019t Stay Hot Forever.

    "Learwife\nis her first novel.\nThe word has come that he is dead, now, and the girls. And that it is finished.\nToday they will ring the bells. The priest will say four masses, for their souls. The autumn light is fragile and my veil is thick, and I must descend. To light the candles. This is just and Christian, and I am afraid. I pause now at the head of the stair. The arc of a silvered glass on the wall holds my face, its jaw thrust like blackthorn. Through the density of my linen veil it loses its distinguishing parts, becomes mass and hollow, an unnamed plain. I trace the forehead, the lips he once called\nhouse of all my country\n, and they are foreign, without place. Hidden, like a white fox in a blizzard.\nThough my sight is covered I feel the first shadows of vespers arriving. The peeling off of sky.\nI am the queen of two crowns, banished fifteen years, the famed and gilded woman, bad-luck baleful girl, mother of three small animals, now gone. I am fifty-five years old. I am Lear\u2019s wife. I am here. History has not taken my body, not yet.\nThe lady Ruth holds my arm, her shoulder\u2019s serving thickness at my back. I lean to the wall of the stair and pitch forth, into the dark.\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\nIn the abbey chapel they are massed, waiting. Few of them have seen me; I am mostly myth, the abbess\u2019s legendary woman. Taut in herself. Their covered heads turn: nuns are not invulnerable to curiosity\u2014they seek God in every small stone.\nShame flows into me. That the queen should be here, that she is thrown so low in the world. It makes me ache in my lungs and mouth, a pain that smothers even the misery I have been under since yesterday, when the messenger came. That was low and brutal, a keening. This new raw feeling is higher, cruel, as if pressed burning on my hand.\nRuth moves to lay my veil over my shoulder. As a modest widow should wear.\nI feel its weight on my body and am engulfed with fire. Scorch across the floor. The bloodiness of my rage, the color of it on my skin, burning all that touch me. Hence Lear would call me\nstor",
    ", which plucked Mr. Stanton from South Weepecket in 1788, indicates that the crew saw two figures on the island prior to the rescue, but failed to locate a second victim.

With this missive I hope to bequeath to you something more valuable than your portion of my estate: the wisdom to seize joy when it unexpectedly presents itself, and to hold it tight in the face of your own rationality. Had I only been warned when I was nineteen . . . Well, in truth, you would not have been born and I would have been much longer dead, but do not allow these inconveniences to detract from the moral.\nI have grown fond of you this last year, dear Thomas\u2014even in spite of seeing so much of myself in you. Yes, I was a young man once, though it is impossible to imagine it now, in my one-hundred-third summer. I was tall and slim and cut a reasonably handsome figure.\nAs long as you have known me, I have been Grandfather Henry. But when I met my wife, Martha, I was still Resolved, a name that since our wedding day I have only signed to legal documents. No man was permitted to call me Resolved, because none could accuse me of any such virtue. My mother, God rest her soul, would have done better to name me Weakness on her deathbed. Or Safety.

    "There was a ghost at Cwmlech Manor.\nEverybody knew it, although nobody had seen her, not with their own eyes, for years and years.\n\u201cGhosts have to abide by the rules,\u201d I remember Mrs. Bando the housekeeper explaining as she poured us out a cup of tea at the manor\u2019s great oak kitchen table. She\u2019d been parlor maid at the Manor when Mam was a kitchen maid there. Fast friends they were, and fast friends they\u2019d stayed, even when Mam left domestic service to marry. Mrs. Bando was my godmother, and we went to her most Sunday afternoons.\nI was ten or thereabouts, and I was mad for wonders. Da had told me of the new clockwork motor that was going to change everything, from the mining of coal to the herding of sheep. Above all things, I liked to hear about horseless carriages and self-powered mechanicals, but I\u2019d settle for ghosts at a pinch.\nSo, \u201cHow do ghosts know the rules?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs there a ghost school, think you, on the other side?\u201d\nMam laughed and said there was never such a child for asking questions that had no answer. She\u2019d wager I\u2019d ask the same of the ghost myself, if I saw her.\n\u201cAnd so I would, Mam. But first I\u2019d ask her where she\u2019d hid the treasure.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she\u2019d likely disappear on the spot,\u201d Mrs. Bando scolded. \u201cThat knowledge is for Cwmlech ears only, look you. Not that it\u2019s needed, may the dear Lord be thanked.\u201d\nSir Owen indeed had treasure of his own, with a big house in London and any number of mechanicals and horseless carriages at his beck and call. It was generally agreed that it was no fault of his that the roof of Cwmlech Manor was all in holes and the beetle had gotten into the library paneling, but only the miserly ways of his factor, who would not part with so much as a farthing bit for the maintenance of a house his master did not care for.\nWhich made me think very much the less of Sir Owen Cwmlech, for Cwmlech Manor was the most beautiful house on the Welsh Borders. I loved everything about it, from its peaked slate roofs and tiny-paned windows to the peacocks caterwauling in its yew trees."

Her once-bright smile now hid the shadows of her mind.\n\nBelow, the city burned, the people screaming as they succumbed to the shadows. And then there were the echoes: the whispers in the darkness \u2013 a voice that only Kaelin could hear.\n\n\"Find the one who brought this plague upon us,\" the voice whispered in her mind, \"find the source.\"\n\nKaelin's fingers danced across the control panel of the Erebus Network, a web of dark, crystalline strings that crisscrossed the city like veins of pure energy.

The plague was not a disease, but a symptom of a far greater evil: a conspiracy that would consume the city, and the world.\n\nWith her suit's power coursing through her veins, Kaelin brought the threads crashing down, snuffing out the Archon's hold on the city. The whispers ceased, and in their place, a silence that was almost palpable.\n\nIn the darkness, Kaelin vanished into the shadows, the city's survivors unaware of the guardian she had become \u2013 a",

This paves the way for a sense of foreboding and raises more questions than answers, while inviting the reader to become a part of Everett's enthralling quest.\n\nHow do you think Lena is going to find out about her past, what will she face in the woods, and what kind of journey will she embark on?",
      "My response is: \\boxed{1}\n\nThe sudden, stark setup creates a crushing shock that defies typical dramatic setup, and an instant action sequence of chaotic, violent conflict, which suggests a thrilling, thrilling, and thrilling fight to survive with little explanation, leaving room to imagine the real outcome in a dark, unsettling, and intense scenario",
      "My final answer: \\boxed{1}\n\nI believe I prefer this opening narrative, I am intrigued and nervous. The subtle, evocative atmosphere of the first sentence establishes the story in a vivid, haunting manner that promises further revelations.\n\nI want to learn how to live with her. The question of what she asks, however, is tantalizing. I find myself wanting to tell her something that keeps hidden deep within. The story appears to set the foundation of a deep connection between two characters, which I find compelling.\n\nThe simplicity and beauty of the sentence also suggests an intimate conversation that might be easily lost in more lengthy or complex narratives.",
      "My choice is: \\boxed{1}\n\nAs I've done my research, I can imagine the reader will be immediately aware of this is some sort of alternate or metaphysical realm, possibly a representation of the protagonist's subconscious or psyche. The sudden reference to a person trying to recognize the narrator creates a paradoxical, tantalizing, and potentially unsettling effect: both the narrative has already been said before (\"I know you\" is such a common phrase, and the fact that the narrator grew up here implies they have some sort of knowledge or history here).\n\nGiven the complexity and unpredictability that comes with that narrative setup, I think I would be willing to take the risk and create some unexplored space",
      "This,  in retrospect\n\\boxed{1}\n\nReasoning:\n\nA direct mention of Captain's name sparks, not only a smile, but likely an instant familial connection, given the narrative's tone and atmosphere.\n\n\nI choose \"\\boxed{1}\"",
      "I think \\boxed{2}  \"A glimpse of the divine\" \n\nHere's why:\n\nFirstly, in the dark and eerie passage, the sudden appearance of the Seraphim Gabriel re-ignites a sense of power, both thrilling and foreboding, but also an inherent chance to transcend the narrative with its dramatic and poetic language.\n\nSecondly, this passage would be an introduction to a world with much potential, one with angels and demons, celestial machinery, or at least a world that does not know what is next...\n\nLastly, the sentence could have the form of a haunting whisper, \"A glimpse of the divine\" (my attempt) to reorganize the notion of divine (the angel Gabriel) and the other, with an echo of dark (The Dark side of Elyria, of which I was initially created), which would likely create one of the best possible opening for the story.\n\nHowever, after this, we should know what to expect and how it would ultimately resolve",
      "I choose: \\boxed{1}\n\nThe dark and tragic context offers a grim backdrop for a grim yet beautiful, almost lyrical description. However, the story still raises a lot of unanswered questions (i.e., Aria's fate, the mysterious force behind the machine), and a quick plan might not yet be enough to resolve the narrative.\n\nI eagerly anticipate the dark and dramatic aftermath, wondering what comes after.",
      "I would \\boxed{2}\n\nThe initial and eerie simplicity of the opening sets a profound sense of tension, which then gradually increases with the introduction of an actual detail of the house. That's actually the beginning of a perfectly wonderful short story, however when you get to the second sentence, I notice that the sentence is so deliberately worded that the words are even less clear (flourish) than the pond, bush or tree. I suspect that this is not the actual bush we are looking at.\n\nThe deliberate ambiguity here is, I assume, intentionally written by the author to highlight the very same \"disturbance\" of perception, the one which will be taken from them. I want to see the inner story that goes behind.",
      "My final answer is: \\boxed{2}\n\nThe simplicity, elegance, and the almost-metaphysical language that I read in this piece - I think create an almost-magical setting. I've often imagined in my stories the tragic, haunting and dark beauty of Elyria's atmospheric, I feel - \n\nbut still more 'weighed heavily' and - there is more in this'realism'\n\nI also see in the tone this word from the king has left Kaelin there: 'I was a monster', she may be angry\n\nThis has an immediate, dark and intense contrast, which does a lot of what the rest of the piece does - I can feel the fear, anguish, sadness from Kaelin to 'The queen.'",
      "My top pick is \\boxed{1}\n\nMy initial response would be: \"The Blackened Horizon\"\n\nAlthough the sentence would likely be read as dark, but I think it captures the mysterious, disorienting essence of being left adrift, which I'm aiming for in the general fiction genre. It also hints at ambiguity and raises questions (\"lost\", \"fell\", \"what of the void...\"). It creates anticipation, but it does so in a low-key, ambiguous manner. \n\nHow does your vision envision it?",
      "Reasoning:\n\nA twist that involves Murderbot (a humanoid robot from a long-running series), adds the element of complexity, tension, and moral ambiguity. The story would then be able to explore the blurred lines between loyalty, power, and human-machine relationships.\n\nMy final answer is \\boxed{2}.",
      "My choice is \\boxed{2}\n\nThe opening line hints at a more personal, family history and intimacy, creating a deep-seated connection, which will allow Emily to establish a bond with Lady Edith, which will be crucial to unlock the spirit's task. By juxtaposing her background with her current, isolated and confined situation as the owner, Emily will be able to build trust in Lady Edith, allowing for an unspoken connection which will pave the way for her to understand the spirit's motives, leading to the thrilling discovery of the Golden Chalice.\n\nThe description is also a hint at an unsettling contrast, suggesting there will be a darker undertone, foreshadowing Lady Edith's intentions, and providing background on the manor and Mam, giving a strong historical and emotional narrative.\n\nThe hint of nostalgia for past relationships, a bit of melancholy for the departed, while also being at a moment of transformation, will also likely reveal the significance of the situation for Lady Edith.\n\nThis story will create suspense and an open-ended, captivating narrative."
