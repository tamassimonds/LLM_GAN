    "When the young half-goblin emperor Maia sought to learn who had set the bombs that killed his father and half-brothers, he turned to an obscure resident of his father\u2019s Court, a Prelate of Ulis and a Witness for the Dead. Thara Celehar found the truth, though it did him no good to discover it. He lost his place as a retainer of his cousin the former Empress, and made far too many enemies among the many factions vying for power in the new Court. The favor of the Emperor is a dangerous coin.\nNow Celehar lives in the city of Amalo, far from the Court though not exactly in exile. He has not escaped from politics, but his position gives him the ability to serve the common people of the city, which is his preference. He lives modestly, but his decency and fundamental honestly will not permit him to live quietly. As a Witness for the Dead, he can, sometimes, speak to the recently dead: see the last thing they saw, know the last thought they had, experience the last thing they felt. It is his duty use that ability to resolve disputes, to ascertain the intent of the dead, to find the killers of the murdered.\nNow Celehar\u2019s skills lead him out of the quiet and into a morass of treachery, murder, and injustice. No matter his own background with the imperial house, Celehar will stand with the commoners, and possibly find a light in the darkness.\nIn the jumbled darkness of the catacombs beneath the city of Amalo, there was a shrine to Ulis in his aspect as god of the moon. It was thousands of years old, and the carving of the four phases of the moon on the plinth had become almost undetectable, worn smooth by generations of reverent fingertips. Whatever the plinth had supported was long gone, but the shrine remained.\nThe shrine was a landmark that every Ulineise prelate in the city knew, and it was frequently used as a meeting place, since it afforded better privacy than the Ulistheileian where formal audiences were held.\nDach\u2019othala Vernezar, the Ulisothala of Amalo, was an elven man of middle age and great ambition. He had h",
    "The first time Paul called, Zhenia was lying in bed, looking at the succulents on the windowsill. They were furry with dust. How long had it been since anybody watered them?\nBen was asleep next to her. He seemed different since coming back from the first round of filming in Atlanta. They\u2019d given him an old-timey haircut and the pomade he\u2019d started using left halos of grease on the pillowcase.\nWhy hadn\u2019t it occurred to her to water and wipe these plants while he was gone?\nZhenia let the phone vibrate on the bed between them. She didn\u2019t recognize the number so she let it go to voicemail. Ben groaned, turned towards the wall and rearranged the pillow between his knees. She wondered when she would start feeling the baby inside of her, and what that would feel like. When she\u2019d googled \u2018quickening\u2019 somebody on a message board described it as a flutter, but she couldn\u2019t really picture that feeling. A phone, vibrating inside of her womb, this she could imagine. The call was coming from inside the house!\nShe got up and boiled water for tea then played the voicemail in case it was something work related. There was a silence at first, and though she couldn\u2019t hear breathing exactly, there was clearly a person on the other end. Then, finally, a man\u2019s voice: \u201cHi, Zhenia.\u201d\nHer name in his mouth sounded like a tangle.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t met. I\u2019m calling about something\u2026 Well, I\u2019d rather explain it to you, not to a machine. It\u2019s about a relative of yours.\u201d\nZhenia set the teakettle down. She turned to Ben on reflex but didn\u2019t wake him. Which relative of hers could this message be about? Her brother, probably. He was just starting his freshman year now at Northwestern, a DJ on the side. Maybe he owed somebody money? After being under their mother\u2019s thumb for so long, it would make sense that he would now find an area in which to be immoderate. Her curiosity was piqued.\nShe poured herself tea and called the number back. A man answered.\n\u201cZhenia!\u201d he said before she had a chance to introduce herself. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you called. My name is Paul",
    "His Last Bow (Kodansha)\nand the 7th Tekken Heterotopia Literary Prize in 2020 for her novel\nTrinity, Trinity, Trinity (Sh\u016beisha).\nThis used to be a place called the Forest of Wild Birds.\nOf course, that wasn\u2019t its official name\u2014it was just what everyone in the area, including the people at Tokyo Electric, called it. A grand forest once grew here, and you could hear birdsong day and night.\nSeveral times a year, they would open the area to the public, and families would come and enjoy themselves. They would spread blue tarps on the grass and stare up at the mountain cherries in full bloom. People would braid flowering white clover into crowns to place on their children\u2019s heads.\nThis place is also the Tokyo Electric Power Company\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, known in the industry as 1F.\nIts grounds are extensive, and they say they once overflowed with green.\n*\nIn the spring of 2017, I took Route 6 north from Iwaki Station to visit the TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. It was April\u2014the government had just recently declared part of the city of Tomioka to no longer be a nuclear exclusion zone. The launching point for tours of the nuclear power plant had long been the J\u2011Village athletic center, which, following the Fukushima disaster, had been used as a relay point for those working to clean it up. But ever since Tokyo was chosen as the site for the next Olympics, J\u2011Village had been undergoing hurried reconstruction so it could be used again for athletics (this led eventually to it being made the Olympic torch relay starting point).\nSo instead, I was heading toward the former \u201cEnergy Museum\u201d at the TEPCO Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant (2F). It juts at a sudden angle to a shopping mall with a sign advertising atomic sushi. The museum is like a fantasy of Western architecture, a set of three conjoined buildings painted in pastels that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in Disneyland. Asking about it, I learned that the three buildings were modeled after the homes of Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, and Thom",
    "While we waited we were visited by the ghosts of the girls who had already died. Those who were closest to the explosion, in the kitchen sneaking butter and bread when the gas ignited, the ones who died immediately, in a sense without injury, the girls who died explosively.\n\nThe dead girls waited with us, amidst the rubble, our heads pillowed on it, our arms and legs canopied by it, some of us punctured by it. The rubble was heavy, of course. The weight of it made us wonder what happened to the softer things. Our sheets and blankets, our letters from home, our Korans, our class notes, the slips of paper we exchanged throughout the day, expressing our affections and disaffections for each other, for our teachers, for the rituals of our contained life. What about the curtains on our windows? we thought. The stories and poems we read to each other at night or the ones we kept private, folded in our pockets? What about our pockets? Our uniforms, our gym skirts, our head scarves and stockings? The too soft pillows we always complained of? The ones the oldest girls hoarded, sleeping with three or four stacked under their cheeks even though their heads sank into the too soft centers and their necks ached in the morning. The explosion, it seemed, turned everything to stone. Except us. We were soft then, softer than we ever were.\nHave you ever seen a buzzard? They are all feathers and fat, not like skeletons at all, but soft like cushions. Except for their beaks and claws.\n*\nThere were day girls and night girls. Day girls went home at three o\u2019clock, swept their mothers\u2019 houses, helped their mothers cook k\u00f6fte and pilaf, slept in beds with their sisters, with their brothers and mothers and fathers in nearby rooms. There were more than a hundred of them; sometimes we confused the names of the youngest. But there were only fourteen of us: older girls in the room on the right, younger girls in the room on the left. Not a door to close in between, so all night long we heard each other giggle and snore and cry and dream and som",
    "Almost, but not quite, impossible.\nAnd when the curtain is pulled back and they see me, sitting on my pedestal, arms raised, branches swaying, they will gasp. As they always do.\nCome See the Living Dryad\nProof that the ancient mythologies were veritable truths!\nYou have read of them in Homer and Hesiod. Now, tonight, you may see for yourself, one of those \u201cdwellers in the lovely groves,\u201d those daughters of Gaia. Living proof that the wonders of the ancient world have not passed away altogether in this age of technological marvels.\nViewing at 8.30, special lecture at 9.00 by Professor L. Merwin, M. Phil., D. Litt., LL.D., Member of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland.\nTickets two shillings, half price for children.\nWho killed Daphne Merwin? By 1888, she was famous enough that the case was mentioned in the\nLondon Times\n:\nA tragedy in Marylebone. On the morning of June 7th, Mrs. Lewison Merwin, who has become famous as Daphne, the Living Dryad, showing nightly at the Alhambra, was found brutally murdered at her home in Marylebone. Her husband, Professor Merwin, is distraught and stated that he does not know who could have committed such a crime, as she had not an enemy in the world. According to Inspector Granby of the Metropolitan Police, Mrs. Merwin was stabbed in the chest with a kitchen knife. This crime was doubly brutal because, due to her physical peculiarities, Mrs. Merwin was unable to defend herself. Members of the public are urged to bring any pertinent information to the attention of the Metropolitan Police, who promise a swift investigation.\nAs this edition of the paper was going to press, the man who would be hanged for her murder had already been arrested. Alfred Potts was a pauper and occasional petty thief. That morning, he had come to the Merwin residence. The maid of all work had let him in at Daphne\u2019s insistence. According to her account, he had offered to do whatever work needed doing of a heavy nature, in exchange for a hot meal. Daphne, who was habitually charitable, sai",
    "\u201cToo rotten,\u201d Tera said.\n\u201cNot if we prepare it by day\u2019s end,\u201d Nev said. \u201cJust the big one, though. The kid, I can\u2019t do anything with.\u201d\nHe pulled out a hexagonal coin stamped with the head of some long-dead upstart; a senator, maybe, or a juris priest. The old folks in charge called themselves all sorts of things over the years, but their money spent the same. He wondered for a minute if the bodies were related; kid and her secondary father, or kid and prime uncle. They were both beginning to turn, now, the bodies slightly bloated, overfull, but he could see the humanity, still; paintings in need of restoration.\n\u201cSome body merc you are!\u201d the old woman said. \u201cUnderpaying for prime flesh. This is good flesh, here.\u201d She rubbed her hands suggestively over the body\u2019s nearly hairless pate.\nNev jabbed a finger at the empty pier behind him; she arrived with her bodies too late\u2014the fish mongers had long since run out of stock, and the early risers had gone home. \u201cIsn\u2019t exactly a crowd, is there?\u201d He pushed his coat out of the way, revealing the curved hilt of his scimitar.\nShe snarled at him. It was such a funny expression, Nev almost laughed. He flipped her the coin and told Tera to bring up the cart. Tera grumbled and snuffled about it, but within a few minutes the body was loaded. Tera took hold of the lead on their trumpeting miniature elephant, Falid, and they followed the slippery boardwalk of the humid lower city into the tiers of the workhouses and machinery shops of the first circle. While they walked, Falid gripped Nev\u2019s hand with his trunk. Nev rubbed Falid\u2019s head with his other hand. Falid had been with him longer than Tera; he\u2019d found the little elephant partly skinned and left to rot in an irrigation ditch ten years before. He\u2019d nursed him back to health on cabbage and mango slices, back when he could afford mangos.\nTera roped Falid to his metal stake in the cramped courtyard of the workshop. Nev fed Falid a wormy apple from the bin\u2014the best they had right now\u2014and helped Tera haul the body inside. They rolled",
    "Onye na-agu edemede a muru ako:\nLet the Reader Beware\nGreetings from the Obi Library Collective of Leopard Knocks\u2019 Department of Responsibility. We are a busy organization with more important things to do. However, we\u2019ve been ordered to write you this brief letter of information. It is necessary that you understand what you are getting into before you begin reading this book. If you already understand, then feel free to skip this warning and jump right into the continuation of Sunny\u2019s story at Chapter 1.\n* * *\nOkay, let\u2019s begin.\nLet the reader beware that there is juju in this book. \u201cJuju\u201d is what we West Africans like to loosely call magic, manipulatable mysticism, or alluring allures. It is wild, alive, and enigmatic, and it is interested in you. Juju always defies definition. It certainly includes all uncomprehended tricksy forces wrung from the deepest reservoirs of nature and spirit. There is control, but never absolute control. Do not take juju lightly, unless you are looking for unexpected death.\nJuju cartwheels between these pages like dust in a sandstorm. We don\u2019t care if you are afraid. We don\u2019t care if you think this book will bring you good luck. We don\u2019t care if you are an outsider. We just care that you read this warning and are thus warned. This way, you have no one to blame but yourself if you enjoy this story.\nNow, this girl Sunny Nwazue lives in southeastern Nigeria (which is considered Igboland) in a village not far from the thriving city of Aba. Sunny is about thirteen and a half now, of the Igbo ethnic group, and \u201cNaijamerican\u201d (which means \u201cNigerian American\u201d\u2014American-born to Nigerian parents, as if you couldn\u2019t consult the Internet for that information). Her two older brothers, Chukwu and Ugonna, were born in Nigeria. Sunny, on the other hand, was born in New York City. She and her family lived there until she was nine, when they moved back to Nigeria. This means she speaks Igbo with an American accent and says \u201csoccer\u201d instead of \u201cfootball.\u201d It also means she has to sometimes deal with cla",
    "Each morning she made breakfast for the boy who worked in the garden. She went to the back door, opened it, and saw him in the distance with his spade. \u2018Half past eight now,\u2019 she said. He was an ugly boy and his eyes were; redder than the cat\u2019s, two crafty cuts in his head forever spying on the first shadows of her breast. She put his food in front of him. When he stood up he always said, \u2018Is there anything you want me to do?\u2019 She had never said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 The boy went back to dig potatoes out of the patch or to count the hens\u2019 eggs, and if there were berries to be picked off the garden bushes she joined him before noon. Seeing the red currants pile up in the palm of her hand, she would think of the stain of the money under the old woman\u2019s mattress. If there were hens to be killed she could cut their throats far more cleanly than the boy who let his knife stay in the wound and wiped the blood on the knife along his sleeve. She caught a hen and killed it, felt its warm blood, and saw it run headless up the path. Then she went in to wash her hands.\nIt was in the first weeks of spring that she made up her mind to kill the old woman upstairs. She was twenty years old. There was so much that she wanted. She wanted a man of her own and a black dress for Sundays and a hat with a flower. She had no money at all. On the days that the boy took the eggs and the vegetables to market she gave him sixpence that the old woman gave her, and the money the boy brought back in his handkerchief she put into the old woman\u2019s hand. She worked for her food and shelter as the boy worked for his, though she slept in a room upstairs and he slept in a straw bed over the empty sheds.\nOn a market morning she walked into the garden so that the plan might be cooled in her head. It was a fine May day with no more than two clouds in the sky, two unshapely hands closing round the head of the sun. \u2018Ifl could fly,\u2019 she thought, \u2018I could fly in at the open window and fix my teeth in her throat.\u2019 But the cool wind blew the thought away. She knew that she",
    "from Tor Books!\nContrary to popular wisdom, death is not the end, nor is it a passage to some transcendent afterlife. Those who die merely awake as themselves on one of a million worlds, where they are\u00a0fated to live until they die again, and wake up somewhere new. All are born only once, but die many times\u2026 until they come at last to the City Unspoken, where the gateway to True Death can be found.\nWayfarers and pilgrims are drawn to the City, which is home to murderous aristocrats, disguised gods and goddesses, a sadistic faerie princess, immortal\u00a0prostitutes and queens, a captive angel, gangs of feral Death Boys and Charnel Girls\u2026 and one very confused New Yorker.\nMy braying heart continues in spite of itself: I am. I am. I am.\nI do not know why I am here, but it is clearly not to Die. I see them, the Dying people, spiritually aged, faces bleached of all color by worlds of weekdays; I see them stumbling through the cathedral forest beneath the Dome. My God, I think they are like birds. Piloted by instinct.\nI\u2019ll spend hours birdwatching there, watching them Die\u2014their bodies evaporate like smoke and the last look on their faces is peace, the first true peace they have known in dozens or hundreds or thousands of lives. Peace comes like a broken clock.\nI hate them for that, the idiot birds who get to Die. If it were within my power to deny the Dying their Deaths, I would. Why should they find peace while I find none?\n\u2014Sylvia Plath,\nEmpty Skies & Dying Arts\nCooper opened his eyes to see a spirit shaped like a woman, who cradled his head in her hands, her hair a halo of pink light that fell over his face. Angel eyes the color of wet straw looked down on him, and she smelled of parchment and old leather. As his eyes adjusted to the light, he saw that her freckled skin was tan, nearly brown, and for a long moment Cooper waited for her to speak.\nThis is heaven\n, she would say.\nYou will find peace here, and oblivion. We will heal your hurts, friend. Welcome home\n, she would say.\nYou have been away too long.\nCooper would s",
    "The first gay man I knew was the undertaker. Mr. Dorsey owned our town\u2019s one funeral home, a small redbrick building to the right of the library and across from a beauty shop called Dazzle\n.\nFrom the library\u2019s circulation desk, you could catch a glimpse of a zip-bagged body unloaded from a white van or sometimes see Mr. Dorsey outside in his black suit, with his thin dark mustache and perfect white teeth, sweeping up cigarette butts after a service. Mr. Dorsey had grown up in my town, studied mortuary science at a nearby college. When his father retired from the family business, he inherited it. Which is to say: once you died, you went to the town queer.\u0097\nThe first gay love poem I read was Frank O\u2019Hara\u2019s \u201cHaving a Coke with You.\u201d I was a college freshman, and I came across it in a book of gay love poetry in the library\u2019s new arrivals section. I don\u2019t remember the title, but the cover showed two shirtless men leaning toward each other beside a vibrantly blue swimming pool. I hid the book under a stack of magazines and read it on the top floor in a tucked away corner behind some engineering journals. I remember the stab of excitement I felt from the ease of O\u2019Hara\u2019s voice: \u201cbecause of my love for you\u201d and, as he says later, \u201cthe fact that you move so beautifully.\u201d How could one man be saying this to another, and with such manic excitement in a \u201cwarm New York 4 o\u2019clock light\u201d?

I kept it folded in my pocket, and carried it everywhere\u2014to class, to the library, even back home where weekends I\u2019d help cut wood for my grandparents\u2019 furnace. Sometimes alone in the grove at the back of their farm, I\u2019d take it out and read it to myself, a poem in my handwriting but not by me, and feel for a moment that I",
    "Our operating theory was that if there were watchers on Mars, if there were still citizens of that place who believed we were worth a second look, the place they were most likely to have their gaze trained was the last place humans had passed their test. We drove a mile north of the road, not wanting travelers\u2014or, mostly, cops\u2014to stop and ask what we were doing. No one was going to bother too much with dots in the distance from the highway. If you were on this road, you were going a long way. No one would want a detour.\nWe had thirty-two characters to write. Crystal\u2019s whole proof was two pages, but she said there was one line we could write that would demonstrate our understanding beyond a doubt. It was the one she had said was the line, the one I didn\u2019t understand. The one that understood distance in a way that, as far as we knew, only one person on Earth could.\nFunnily enough, our first step was to measure the distances we\u2019d be writing on. We could proceed well enough on the part of it we grasped. We were Newtonian mechanics in the age of relativity. I had bought four tellurometers, state-of-the-art surveying equipment, the fanciest ingredient in the recipe. Mapping out the spaces right when you\u2019re working in two dimensions but exist in only one of them, in terms of relative size, is both more important and more difficult than most people realize.

Coming of age in pre-Code Hollywood, she knows how dangerous the movie business is and how limited the roles are for a Chinese American girl from Hungarian Hill\u2014but she doesn\u2019t care. She\u2019d rather play a monster than a maid.\nBut in Luli\u2019s world, the worst monsters in Hollywood are not the ones on screen.

For those who do survive to earn their fame, success comes with a steep price. Luli is willing to do whatever it takes\u2014even if that means becoming the monster herself.\nSiren Queen\noffers up an enthralling exploration of an outsider achieving stardom on her own terms, in a fantastical Hollywood where the monsters are real and the magic of the silver screen illuminates every page.\nI\nWolfe Studios released a tarot deck\u2019s worth of stories about me over the years.

    "CHAPTER ONE\nAs I hustled out from the hangar into the Persian Gulf twilight, my muscles tightened, and power flowed into my hands. Soon I would do what I did best. Soon I would kill a sorcerer.\nThe U.S. Army base tarmac gave off a blistering heat mirage as I scrambled across it. A helicopter\u2019s blades rotated at ready; their wash blasted hot as I boarded. The door slammed behind me, and the copter, christened\nValkyrie\n, took off.\nThe five men of my team saluted, then went back to checking their equipment.

It is a big, battered purple volume, with a circular window-like cover image that shows clashing armies. He has to lift it with both of his four-year-old hands. He struggles with its weight and finally slams it down onto the table in front of me.\nThe Last Battle\n, by C.S. Lewis, I note with a sigh.\nThat means difficult questions.\nFor the past few subjective days, the tiny main vir of our ship, the\nWardrobe\n, has been a calm place. I created it based on a dream Matjek told me about. It is an incense-scented labyrinth of high bookshelves full of haphazardly stacked books of all sizes and colours. Matjek and I usually sit at a rough wooden table in the small caf\u00e9 area in the front, brightly lit by diffuse sunlight through the display windows.\nOutside \u2013 painted on the imaginary glass for us by the vir \u2013 is the turbulent flow of the Highway, thousands of lightwisps, rockships, calmships, beamriders and other craft of every kind, reflected from the\nWardrobe\n\u2019s solar sails in a myriad glinting fragments. And somewhere in the back, in the shadows, the blue and silver books that hold the fractally compressed minds of the people and jinni and gods of Sirr whisper to each other with papery voices.\nUntil now, Matjek has been reading his books quietly, leaning his chin on his fists. Which has suited me fine: I have been busy looking for Mieli in the death cries of Earth.\n\u2018They can\u2019t just all die! It\u2019s not fair!\u2019 Matjek says.\nI look at him and make my sole Highway-zoku jewel \u2013 an emerald crystal disc with a tracery of milky veins inside, a gift from a friendly cetamorph \u2013 spin between my fingers.",

He checked the locks three times, then sighed, closing his eyes. The Radiants were gone.\nHe\u2019d survived so, so many things, but this escape felt narrower than the others. He couldn\u2019t help thinking that the payment for his frighteningly long life was coming due.\nEven after all this time, he didn\u2019t want to die.\nHe put his back to the door, breathing hard. Should he have gone with them? Eyes closed, he tried to remember the man he\u2019d once been, the hero who had fought for thousands of years. His life seemed a blur, a wash of grey and brown, a fresh painting left out in the storm. These days he felt only panic, indecision, and a crushing darkness. Always nearby, always threatening him. Without Ishar holding some of it back\u2026 it would have destroyed him long ago.\nBut he\u2019d survived. He\u2019d\nsurvived\n.\nWhat if the Ghostbloods sent others? Thaidakar wanted him. Thaidakar, a Herald from another world, a creature who was resourceful and brutal.\nI need to hide somewhere else,\nKalak thought.\nYes. I will gather my things and\u2026 and I will go.\nHe rushed into his study, opening the door and stepping through.\nImmediately, the drapes from the window beside the door seized him, wrapping around him like two grasping hands, pulling him tight. They\u2019d been cut into strange shapes. What was this? Some art of Stonewards? He panicked, but the cloth\u2014moving on its own\u2014filled his mouth. Like a constrictor from the old world, it bound him, tied around him, then slammed him against the wall and held him there.\nHe whimpered.\n\u201cWell hello, Herald,\u201d said a man sitting at Kalak\u2019s desk. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I have a few questions.\u201d\nHe was a foreigner, with long mustaches and a short stat",
    "Chapter 1\nEach sunday afternoon at Saint Etheldreda\u2019s School for Young Ladies on Prickwillow Road in Ely, Cambridgeshire, the seven enrolled young ladies were invited by custom to join Headmistress Constance Plackett while she entertained her younger brother, Mr. Aldous Godding, at the dinner table. The privilege of watching the headmistress and her regular Sunday guest consume the veal that they, the young ladies themselves, had prepared, more than compensated for the lack of sufficient veal for all the table to share. The girls had learned to be content with buttered bread and hot beans, Sundays upon end. Such self-denial would serve them well in their future callings as wives. This was Mr. Aldous Godding\u2019s firm belief, and his sister, the widow Mrs. Plackett, with years of matrimonial experience behind her, could only agree.\nOn one particular Sunday evening in May, midway through the meal, Mrs. Plackett sopped her plate with her bread, took a bite of it, and let the morsel fall to the floor, whilst her head lolled back upon her shoulders, and her eyes gazed blankly at the ceiling. She shuddered. She shook. She let out a choking cough, then fell silent.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Connie?\u201d her brother demanded between mouthfuls. \u201cSpeak up, woman. It isn\u2019t decent goggling about like that. Pass the pepper, Missy.\u201d This he addressed to Disgraceful Mary Jane, who sat nearest to him, but he neither knew her name nor the source of her disgrace. All the young ladies were \u201cMissy\u201d to him.\nDisgraceful Mary Jane passed the pepper. Mr. Godding used it liberally, ate a bite of veal, laid down his knife and fork, touched his beard with his napkin, and rose from his seat. He made his way around the table to where his sister sat, raised his arm to thump her back, then choked, clutched his throat, fell forward, and landed on the floor with a thud that reverberated up the legs of the chairs upon which the seven young ladies sat.\n\u201cDead, I imagine,\u201d Dour Elinor observed.\nSmooth Kitty slipped from her chair and went softly to the headmistr"

But now, they stood as a testament to human ingenuity and innovation.\n\nThe museum entrance, a gleaming glass and steel structure, beckoned me towards the main building.

It was where Emily's sister, Lucy, had retreated to the day her mother passed away. The creaky floorboards groaned beneath Emily's feet as she pushed open the door, a faint scent of old books and dust wafting out. The air was heavy with secrets, and she felt the weight of her mother's presence all around her.\n\nAs she wandered through the dusty rooms, Emily stumbled upon a tattered old trunk, adorned with intricate carvings of flowers and vines. Lucy had left it here, hidden away from prying eyes, where she could collect her thoughts and memories. Emily's fingers brushed against the lid, feeling the faint chill of her sister's presence. She turned the handle, and a faint whisper seemed to caress her ear: \"Don't forget, Emily.\"\n\nEmily's heart skipped a beat. She spun around, but there was no one there. The room seemed to fade away, replaced by the soft glow of moonlight streaming through the grimy windows. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that the whisper was coming from her own heart. She took a step closer to the trunk, her fingers tracing the curves of the lid.\n\nSuddenly, the trunk creaked open, and a faint draft swept out, carrying the whispers of the past. Emily's eyes landed on a faded photograph of Lucy, a bright smile on her face. She gasped, her heart racing. In the photograph, Lucy was standing with her mother, their arms entwined. The smile was the same one Emily's mother had always worn when she was young. The words \"I'll be waiting\" etched on the edge of the frame seemed to echo through the room, reminding Emily that she wasn't alone.",

She had grown up hearing stories about the town's history from her grandmother, who had lived there for over 50 years. As a child, she would often sneak in to visit the old librarian, Mrs. Jenkins, who would regale her with tales of the town's struggles and triumphs.\n\nOn this particular afternoon, Emily was searching for a book on her great-great-grandmother's life. She had always been fascinated by the stories of her family's history, but the few books she had found were either incomplete or outdated. As she browsed through the shelves, her fingers trailing over the spines of the old volumes, she stumbled upon a tattered book with a strange symbol etched onto its cover.\n\nMrs. Jenkins noticed her interest and approached her, eyeing the book with a knowing glint in her eye. \"Ah, you've found the one,\" she said, leading Emily to a shelf hidden away at the back of the library. \"That's a rare copy of 'The Journal of Elizabeth Taylor, 1850-1870'.\"\n\nAs Emily opened the book, she was struck by the handwriting - it was her great-great-grandmother's, but with a few notable differences. The writing was beautiful, but it also seemed...different. The ink was darker, the letters more cursive. Suddenly, it clicked into place - Elizabeth Taylor was not just a historical figure, but a direct descendant of the real Elizabeth Taylor, the actress.\n\n<story>Emily's mind reeled as she read on, discovering that her great-great-grandmother had been a socialite, a suffragette, and a passionate abolitionist.

Lena's eyes adjusted to the darkness, and she spotted a faint light in the distance. \"There,\" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the pounding of their hearts. \"That's the ventilation shaft.\"\n\nWithout hesitation, Max pushed Lena through the narrow opening, and they dropped down into the dimly lit room. The air was stale, but the smell of damp earth and sweat filled their nostrils. A figure slumped in the center of the room, its features obscured by a tattered blanket. Max's eyes locked onto Lena's, and he knew in that moment that he'd do anything to save her.\n\nBut as they approached, a cold, metallic voice spoke, echoing off the walls. \"You shouldn't have come here, Max. You'll never leave.\" A figure emerged from the shadows, its body twisted and deformed, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly energy. Lena's gaze locked onto its face, and she whispered, \"Ava.\" The creature's eyes locked onto hers, and it began to move towards her, its hands grasping for her like claws. Max drew Lena close, his heart racing with fear, as the creature's fingers closed around her wrist, pulling her towards its twisted face. He knew he had to act fast \u2013 not just to save Lena, but to save the woman he loved.",

But today, she felt a shiver run down her spine as she pushed open the creaky door.\n\nAs she stepped inside, the silence was almost deafening. Lena's eyes adjusted slowly to the dim light, and she made out the rows of dusty tomes that lined the shelves. But it was the corner of the room that caught her attention. A section of the wall seemed slightly out of place, as if it had been recently rearranged. Lena approached the wall, and her fingers trailed over the strange symbols etched into the stone. They seemed to pulse with a soft, blue light.\n\nSuddenly, a low hum filled the air, and a figure coalesced in front of her. Lena's breath caught in her throat as a woman with skin like moonlight and hair like the night sky appeared before her. The woman's eyes locked onto Lena's, and she felt a jolt of electricity run through her veins.\n\nThe woman spoke in a voice that was both familiar and strange, saying, \"You have been chosen.\" Lena's mind reeled as the woman reached out a hand and touched her forehead.

The woman's touch was gentle, yet powerful, and Lena felt a sense of wonder and awe wash over her. When the vision faded, Lena stumbled backward, gasping for air.

    "judge_outputs": [
      "To determine which story is better, I'll analyze the plot, characters, and themes in both stories.\n\n**Story 1**:\n\n* The story has a clear and straightforward plot, with a defined goal (a meeting with a powerful faction to discuss a compromise). The protagonist (Elara) is introduced early on, and the story takes a turn into a complex web of intrigue and power dynamics.\n* The protagonist is a strong character with agency, and their actions drive the plot forward.\n* The story explores themes of power, politics, and the consequences of power.\n\n**Story 2**:\n\n* The story is more ambiguous, with a less clear goal and a more open-ended conclusion.\n* The protagonist is more of a background character, and their actions are driven by circumstance rather than agency.\n* The story lacks a strong focus on character development and themes.\n\nBased on these observations, I would say that **Story 1** is better. It has a more defined plot, a strong protagonist, and explores themes of power and intrigue, which are more nuanced and engaging. Story 2 is more focused on background and circumstance, which makes it feel more meandering and less compelling.",
      "After analyzing both stories, I think **STORY 1** is better.\n\nThe story raises more interesting questions and explores the character's emotional journey in a more nuanced way. By introducing the mysterious caller, the story sets the stage for a deeper exploration of Lena's relationship with her great-aunt Emilia, and the revelation that Lena had been neglecting their family's history. This creates a sense of intimacy and shared secrets that will likely lead to a more engaging narrative.\n\nThe use of the medium as a catalyst for the story also creates a unique and intriguing plot device, and the idea of translating and transcribing the relative's memoir raises the stakes and creates tension. This plot point allows for a more detailed and emotional exploration of Lena's character.\n\nThe story also has a more satisfying resolution, as Lena finally receives the closure and understanding that comes with hearing the stories of her loved ones. The second story, while more straightforward, feels more like a setup for a mystery or a thriller, which may not be as engaging for the reader.",
      "After analyzing the two stories, I would choose **1** as the better story. Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe first story creates a vivid and immersive atmosphere by using sensory details such as the \"birdsong\" that \"could be heard day and night\" in the forest. The use of words like \"rusting hulks\" and \"sentinels\" effectively conveys a sense of industrial decay and abandonment. The image of families enjoying themselves in the forest also adds a sense of nostalgia and wonder.\n\nIn contrast, the second story takes a more somber and eerie tone, with a focus on the industrial landscape and the sense of unease that pervades the atmosphere. While the image of the former nuclear power plant is certainly striking, it's not as engaging or evocative as the first story's sensory details and nostalgic tone.\n\nThe second story's focus on the industrial setting and the sense of unease creates a sense of foreboding, which doesn't quite match the first story's more hopeful and exploratory tone. The final sentence, \"The museum entrance, a gleaming glass and steel structure, beckoned me towards the main building,\" is particularly effective in conveying the contrast between the former and current state of the nuclear power plant.\n\nOverall, the first story has a more engaging and immersive atmosphere, with a greater emphasis on sensory details and a more nuanced exploration of the emotions and thoughts of the narrator.",
      "Here's my analysis:\n\nThe two stories offer distinct perspectives on the concept of girlhood, sisterhood, and tragedy in a boarding school setting. While both stories explore the idea of a sense of waiting or anticipation, they approach it from different angles.\n\nStory 1 sets a somber and eerie tone, describing the ghosts of girls who died in the kitchen, their bodies preserved in a state of suspended animation. This narrative effectively conveys the sense of stillness and quiet that pervades the story, evoking a feeling of being watched and waiting. The use of phrases like \"the weight of it made us wonder what happened to the [girl's]\" creates a sense of foreboding and mystery. This approach also highlights the tragic nature of the event, emphasizing the impact it had on the surviving girls.\n\nStory 2, on the other hand, takes a more introspective and melancholic approach, focusing on Emily's emotional journey as she discovers a tattered trunk in the attic room. This story is more character-driven, exploring Emily's emotional state and her relationship with her sister Lucy. While it still touches on the theme of waiting and anticipation, it does so in a more subtle and nuanced way, using the setting of the attic to convey the sense of secrecy and isolation.\n\nIn terms of tension and emotional resonance, Story 2 has a stronger impact, as it humanizes Emily and her relationship with her sister. The story raises questions about the nature of grief, memory, and the passage of time. The use of the trunk as a symbol of secrets and the creaking floorboards creates a sense of unease and foreboding that lingers long after the story ends.\n\nWhile Story 1 is effective in conveying a sense of tragedy and the impact of the event, I believe Story 2 is more emotionally resonant and impactful, as it explores the complexities of sibling relationships and the weight of memories long after the event has passed.\n\nTherefore, **[2]**",
      "After analyzing the two stories, I think **STORY 1: Come See the Living Dryad** is better.\n\nThe main difference between the two stories is the setting and the context in which the character discovers the connection to a historical figure. In the first story, Emily is researching a book in a dusty, small-town library, where she stumbles upon a book about the Dryad myth. The atmosphere is one of discovery and curiosity, which creates a sense of excitement and wonder. This setting effectively creates a sense of immersion and authenticity.\n\nIn contrast, Story 2 takes place in a small-town library in rural Tennessee, which is a more mundane and ordinary setting. The story focuses on Emily's personal journey of discovery, but the setting is more generic and doesn't have the same level of emotional resonance as the first story.\n\nAdditionally, the language and tone in Story 1 are more vivid and engaging, with phrases like \"as they will gasp\" and \"proof that the ancient mythologies were veritable truths!\" which create a sense of awe and excitement. In Story 2, the language is more straightforward and less evocative.\n\nOverall, the first story has a more compelling and immersive setting, a more engaging narrative, and a more effective use of language, which makes it the better story.",
      "After analyzing both stories, I think **STORY 1** is better.\n\nThe first story has a clear and concise narrative that effectively conveys the tension and urgency of the situation. The use of the fluorescent lights and eerie shadows creates a sense of foreboding, and the cryptic message on the paper sets up a sense of mystery and tension. The character development of Max and Lena is also well-done, making it easy to understand their motivations and actions. The story also raises questions and creates a sense of anticipation, making the reader curious about what will happen next.\n\nIn contrast, the second story is a bit more disjointed and lacks a clear structure. The sentence \"Too rotten\" is a bit of a non-sequitur, and the transition to the hexagonal coin is unclear. The introduction of the senator and the old folks in charge is also a bit confusing. Additionally, the mention of the \"big one\" feels like a non-sequitur and doesn't add much to the story.\n\nOverall, **STORY 1** has a more cohesive and engaging narrative, making it a more compelling read.",
      "The story that is better is:\n\n**Story 1: \"Onye na-agu edemede a muru ako: Let the Reader Beware\"**\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\nThe story sets a foreboding tone and creates a sense of unease from the very beginning, hinting at the mysterious and potentially ominous nature of the mystical creature and its gift. The use of the phrase \"Let the Reader Beware\" is a classic trope that warns the reader of the potential dangers and consequences of meddling with forces beyond their understanding. The warning creates a sense of tension and raises questions about the consequences of the protagonist's actions, making the reader curious and engaged. Additionally, the introduction of the mysterious and powerful creature creates a sense of wonder and excitement, making the story more engaging and immersive. Overall, the story effectively establishes a sense of foreboding and tension, which is a hallmark of a compelling and well-crafted story.",
      "The better story is:\n\n**STORY 1**\n\nThe story starts with a clear sense of desperation and frustration, as Emma feels trapped in her small town and yearns for something more. The contrast between her mundane job and her secret dreams of escape creates a strong emotional resonance. The description of the familiar routine and the feeling of numbness is vivid and relatable, making the reader feel like they're experiencing Emma's emotions firsthand.\n\nThe mysterious customer's offer of a sum of money to escape creates a sense of hope and excitement, which is hard to resist. The way the customer offers a chance to start fresh and leave the small town behind suggests a sense of liberation and possibility. The fact that Emma is forced to consider this option after feeling trapped makes the reader question whether she'll take the chance and make the leap.\n\nThe story also raises questions about the nature of freedom and the consequences of taking a chance on a new life. This creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, making the reader want to know what Emma decides to do.\n\nIn contrast, **STORY 2** is more flat and lacks a clear conflict or tension. The boy's constant presence and the phrase \"the cat's eyes\" are more of a narrative device than a driving force behind Emma's actions. The story also lacks a clear resolution or consequence, making it feel more like a vignette than a fully fleshed-out narrative.\n\nOverall, **STORY 1** is a more engaging and suspenseful story that raises important questions about the human condition, making it the better choice.",
      "Both stories are intriguing, but I would choose **1**.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nThe story sets up a unique and thought-provoking premise, where the concept of death is not just a natural part of life, but a continuous cycle of rebirth and reincarnation. The idea of a city called the City Unspoken, where death is a gateway to true liberation, is captivating. The mysterious guide, Er, adds a layer of mystery and intrigue, and the description of the city as a place of murder and aristocracy creates a sense of foreboding. The story raises questions about the nature of reality and the human condition, making it more engaging and thought-provoking.\n\nIn contrast, while Story 2, while interesting, feels more predictable and straightforward. The concept of death as a punishment for past mistakes is a common trope, and the addition of a \"pilgrim\" character, Lena, feels more like a convenience than a fully fleshed-out character. The world of Elysium, on the other hand, is more fully realized and immersive, with a richly detailed city and a mysterious guide who seems to hold the key to understanding the true nature of reality.",
      "Based on the two stories, I would recommend **1**.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nThe first story, \"Lena,\" creates a more relatable and engaging protagonist, Lena, and sets the stage for a narrative that explores themes of self-discovery and acceptance. The story's focus on Lena's nervousness and initial reactions to the unfamiliar setting creates a sense of intimacy and immediacy, drawing the reader into her emotional experience. The contrast between the bright, cheerful atmosphere of the diner and Lena's reserved personality makes her vulnerability and bravery more palpable.\n\nIn contrast, the second story, \"Mr. Dorsey,\" is more of a descriptive passage that establishes Mr. Dorsey as a mysterious figure, without fully exploring his character or emotions. While this could be effective for a more straightforward, observational story, it may not be as engaging or emotionally resonant as the first story.\n\nOverall, the first story is more character-driven and focuses on Lena's personal journey, making it a more compelling and relatable read.",
      "After analyzing the two stories, I would say that **STORY 2 is better**.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. **Teamwork and coordination**: The story highlights the importance of teamwork and coordination among the group members, with each person knowing their role and working together seamlessly. This is a key aspect of effective teamwork, and the passage effectively conveys the sense of unity and cooperation among the team members.\n2. **Consequences of failure**: The story also implies that failure is not an option, as the team is working towards a major task and the stakes are high. This adds a sense of tension and urgency to the narrative, making it more engaging and suspenseful.\n3. **Emotional connection**: The story also creates a sense of emotional connection between the team members, particularly through the character of Jack, the young journalist. His role as a \"reporter\" adds a human element to the team and raises the stakes, making the reader more invested in the outcome.\n4. **Scientific and technological themes**: The story also explores scientific and technological themes, such as the development of a new type of material, which adds depth and complexity to the narrative.\n\nIn contrast, the first story is more focused on the plot and the journey, but lacks the emotional connection and teamwork that make STORY 2 more engaging.",
      "Both stories have their unique elements, but I would rate Story 2 as the better option.\n\nThe first story, while setting a strong narrative tone, feels somewhat predictable and lacks a clear plot or character development. The stakes are minimal, and the protagonist's goals seem unconnected to her true aspirations. The description of the nickelodeon as a \"mysterious woman\" offering her a chance at stardom feels more like a setup for a melodramatic plot twist than a genuine character development.\n\nThe second story, on the other hand, creates a more immersive atmosphere and establishes a clear character arc. The protagonist's connection to the old movie theater and the nostalgic feeling of the sign is vivid and evocative. The story also raises questions about the value of pursuing one's passions and the risks involved in chasing stardom. This narrative has more depth, complexity, and emotional resonance, making it a more engaging and satisfying read.",
      "After analyzing both passages, I would rate the second story as better.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nThe first story is a straightforward action-oriented passage, setting up the mission and introducing the protagonist. However, it lacks a clear conflict or tension, and the protagonist's skills and abilities are not developed beyond their typical military training.\n\nIn contrast, the second story introduces a more complex and intriguing plot, with the protagonist facing unexpected challenges related to magic and sorcery. The use of magical elements adds a layer of unpredictability to the mission, creating tension and raising the stakes. The passage also hints at the complexity of the warlord's powers and the protagonist's abilities, making the story more engaging and suspenseful. Additionally, the protagonist's skills are put to the test in a more nuanced and challenging way, making the mission more believable and realistic.\n\nOverall, the second story offers a more well-rounded and engaging narrative, with a more developed protagonist and a more complex plot, which makes it a more compelling and better story.",
      "After analyzing the two stories, I conclude that **Story 2: Alexandra \"Lexi\" Thompson was a master of the shadows. A former CIA operative turned freelance hacker, she had a reputation for getting in and out of tight spots with ease. Her latest mission was a high-stakes game of cat and mouse. She had been hired by a wealthy tech mogul to retrieve a valuable piece of intel from a rogue scientist who had stolen it from a top-secret research facility. The scientist, Dr. Rachel Kim, was a brilliant but reclusive genius, and Lexi knew she was holding the key to a massive economic disaster.\n\n**Why Story 2 is better:**\n\n* Lexi's background as a former CIA operative and hacker adds a layer of depth and credibility to the story, making her a more believable and formidable protagonist.\n* The high-stakes nature of the mission and the villainous scientist adds an element of tension and danger, making the story more engaging and suspenseful.\n* The character development of Lexi as a complex and multi-faceted protagonist is more fully fleshed out in this story, allowing for a more nuanced exploration of her skills and motivations.\n* The story also raises questions about the ethics of espionage and the consequences of playing with fire, adding a layer of moral complexity to the narrative.\n\nIn contrast, Story 1 is more of a straightforward action-adventure tale with a clear villain and a straightforward resolution. While it has some interesting ideas, it feels more formulaic and less nuanced than Story 2.",
      "After analyzing the two passages, I believe that **Story 2** is better. Here's why:\n\nThe passage effectively conveys Kalak's introspection and emotional turmoil by using sensory details like the \"rain-soaked streets\" and \"droplets pattering against the glass\" to create a somber atmosphere. The use of the word \"wound\" to describe the memory that refuses to heal also suggests a deeper emotional pain, which is a common theme in many stories about difficult decisions.\n\nIn contrast, the first passage is more straightforward and lacks the emotional resonance. While it effectively sets the scene and establishes Kalak's situation, it doesn't convey the same level of introspection and emotional depth. The use of the word \"refused\" to describe the wound also feels more clich\u00e9d and less nuanced than the \"refused to heal\" phrase in the second passage.\n\nOverall, the second passage is more effective at evoking a sense of emotional complexity and resonance, making it a more compelling and satisfying read.",
      "After analyzing both stories, I conclude that Story 2 is better.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nWhile both stories have a similar atmosphere and setting, the tone of Story 2 is darker and more ominous. The use of words like \"stormy night\", \"shroud\", and \"damp\" creates a sense of foreboding, which is more effective in conveying a sense of unease and tension. Additionally, the description of the students' conversations and laughter carrying through the darkness suggests that something is amiss, and the mysterious circumstances surrounding the dinner party.\n\nIn contrast, the atmosphere of Story 1 is more innocuous and lighthearted, with the focus being on the pleasure of eating and socializing. While the tension is still present, it's more subtle and understated.\n\nThe character of Emily Wilson, in particular, is more active and engaged in Story 2, with her eyes fixed on the candlelight and her sense of unease palpable. This suggests that she is more likely to notice something is amiss and take action.\n\nOverall, Story 2 creates a more suspenseful and intriguing atmosphere, making it a more compelling and engaging read."
